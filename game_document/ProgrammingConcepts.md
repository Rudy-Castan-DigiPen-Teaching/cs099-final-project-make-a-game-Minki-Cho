TEAM NAME: Zombies

GAME NAME: Zombie defense

NAME: MINKI CHO, MINJAE YU

PROGRAMING LANGUAGE: Java Script(p5.js)


GAME DESCRIPTION:  It is Zombie Defense Game

    The game requires player and AI survivors to survive until rescue teams come, destroying the approaching zombies. Since there is not much food and supplies left, you, the main character, and a military-turned-leader, must choose one victim every day when you survive, so everything depends on your choice.

## <span style="color:skyblue"> Shapes </span>

When the mouse cursor is on the ai, it is used as a decoration of expressions to see the value of the AI.

    if ( ai_1.x - 30 < mouseX && mouseX < ai_1.x + 30 && ai_1.y - 30 < mouseY && mouseY < ai_1.y + 30 )
            {
                fill("white");
                rect(ai_1.x + 50, ai_1.y-10,250,50);
	. . .

In credit there are two rectangles for the decoration box.

    rect(30,120,300,360);
    rect(660,120,300,100)

This rectangle is for gauge for reload.

    rect( mouseX, mouseY + 20, reload_time, 5);

To notice the wall hp in screen.

    fill( 'red' );
    rect( line_size / 3, line_size * 3 - 15, 30, 5 );
    fill( 'green' );
    rect( line_size / 3, line_size * 3 - 15, this.wall_health_bar, 5 );

## <span style="color:skyblue"> Colors </span>

It was mainly used to change the color of text. I used it for more noticeable.

    textSize( 20 );
    fill( "black" );
    text( "Choose one survivor to sacrifice to survive your next day.", width / 3, height / 2 );
 
## <span style="color:skyblue"> Variables </span>

        zombies_final_wave10;

## <span style="color:skyblue"> Conditional Statements </span>

In ai_1.js ~ ai_4.js if ai 1,2,3,4 are alive then arm image will draw by fire or not.

    if ( ai_1_survived == true )
            {
                push();
                imageMode( CENTER )

                if ( ai_bullet_fired === false )
                {
                    image( ai_arm_img, this.x + 10, ( ( 0 * line_size ) + line_size / 2 ) - 5 );
                }
                else if ( ai_bullet_fired === true )
                {
                    image( ai_gun_recoil_img, this.x + 10, ( ( 0 * line_size ) + line_size / 2 ) - 5 );
                }
                image( ai_img, this.x, ( ( 0 * line_size ) + line_size / 2 ) );
                pop();
            }

In credit if mouse is on these value than image will draw.

    if ( mouseX < width - 30 && mouseX > width - 80 )
        {
            if ( mouseY < height - 30 && mouseY > height - 80 )
            {
                imageMode(CORNER );
                image( gray_back_img, width - 80, height - 80 );
            }
        }
All of these conditional statement is for transparency for image when new day start this statements will work. (day_img.js, fadeout.js)

    if ( day1_transparency > 0 ) day1_transparency -= 1;
    tint( 255, day1_transparency );
    image( day1_img, width / 4, 80 );

    if ( screen_transparency < 255 )
    {
        screen_transparency += 2.5;
        tint( 0, screen_transparency );
        imageMode( CORNER );
        image( black_screen_img, 0, 0 );
    }

     if ( final_day_screen_transparency < 255 )
    {
        fill( "white" );
        textSize( 30 );
        text( "Rescue team will come 30min later... I have to keep fighting!", width / 9 + 10, text_transparency );
        final_day_screen_transparency += 2.5;
        text_transparency++;
        tint( 0, final_day_screen_transparency );
        imageMode( CORNER );
        image( black_screen_img, 0, 0 );
    }

    if ( tint_value < 255 ) tint_value += 1;
    tint( 255, tint_value );
    image( game_over_img, 100, 100 );


This statement is for game ending. when screen_transparency is 255 than text will draw. This text will move down and if it goes to 150 than new text will come out. and game over image will be transparent if tint value is less than 255 (gameover.js)

            if ( screen_transparency == 255 )
        {
            push();
            textSize( 20 );
            fill( 'black' );
            text( "Suddenly a lot of zombies appeared before the rescue team arrived.\n\n" +
                "I fought the zombies hard, but there are too many...\n\n" +
                "Even ammo is almost empty...\n\n" +
                "No... NO!!! \n\n" +
                "In the end, all the survivors died.\n\n", 70, text_y_pos2 );
            text_y_pos2--;
            pop();
            if ( text_y_pos2 < 150 )
            {
                push();
                textSize( 25 );
                textFont( new_text_font );
                text( 'Press R to restart!', 20, 40 );
                text( ' Your score is      ', 20, 440 );
                textSize( 40 );
                fill( 'black' );
                text( score, 200, 440 );
                imageMode( CORNER );
                if ( tint_value < 255 ) tint_value += 1;
                tint( 255, tint_value );
                image( game_over_img, 100, 100 );
                pop();
            }
        }

If mouse is inside these value a new image will come out. (main_menu.js)

    //play_button
    if ( mouseX < 950 && mouseX > 600 )
    {
        if ( mouseY < 180 && mouseY > 80 )
        {
            image( menu_focus_img, 600, 80 );
        }
    }
    //how_to_play_button
    if ( mouseX < 950 && mouseX > 600 )
    {
        if ( mouseY < 310 && mouseY > 210 )
        {
            image( menu_focus_img, 600, 210 );
        }
    }
    //credit_button
    if ( mouseX < 950 && mouseX > 600 )
    {
        if ( mouseY < 440 && mouseY > 340 )
        {
            image( menu_focus_img, 600, 340 );
        }
    }

If text y position is less than -350 than y is 500 and if y pos is less than -100 fadeout effect will came out if this transparency is 255 than game will start.  It is for text effect. (story.js)

    if ( text_y_pos < -350 )
        {
            text_y_pos = 500;
        }
        if(text_y_pos < -100)
        {
            fadeout();
            if ( screen_transparency == 255 )
            {
                game_mode = GAME_START;
            }
        }

If bullet is out of canvas than it will delete from the array.

         if ( bullet[ i ].x <= 0 || bullet[ i ].y <= 0 || bullet[ i ].x >= width+20 || bullet[ i ].y >= height )
        {
            bullet.splice( i, 1 );
        } //if ball goes out of frame, delete the ball from the array

If there are collision with zombie and bullet the zombie's hp will decrease and when it become 0 or less than zombie will delete. (collision.js)

         if ( distance < zombie_size )
            {
                //console.log( "hit" );
                day_count[ i ].collision_effects();
                day_count[ i ].zombie_hp -= gun_damage; //reduce zombie_hp
                bullet.splice( bullet_count, 1 );

                if ( day_count[ i ].zombie_hp <= 0 ) //remove zombie when zombie_hp is 0
                {
                    image( blood_img, day_count[ i ].x, day_count[ i ].y )
                    day_count.splice( i, 1 );
                    score++;
                }
                break;
            }

I divided line into 5 and if i==2 is player position and it will draw player. (game_background.js)

        function drawing_lines_characters()//drawing lines and characters
    {
        for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
    
            if(i === 2)//player position
            {
                . . .

When bullet fired is true image will draw. When bullet come out bullet_fired variable will be true. (game_background.js)

    if(bullet_fired === true)
                {
                    image(gun_recoil, 0, 0);
                }
                else
                {
                    image(character_arm_img, 0, 0); 
                }

If gamemode is intermission if the mouse is on arrow which is image in right bottom than it will draw another color arrow to know mouse is focus in there. (intermission_arrow.js)

    if ( mouseX < 950 && mouseX > 900 )
    {
        if ( mouseY < 450 && mouseY > 400 )
        {
            image( arrow_focus, 900, 400 );
            if ( mouseIsPressed )
            {
                if ( ai_picked == true && !ready_for_day2 )
                {
                    ready_for_day2 = true;
                    ai_picked = false;
                    player_gun_bullet = 7;
                }

                if ( ai_picked == true && !ready_for_day3 )
                {
                    ready_for_day3 = true;
                    ai_picked = false;
                    player_gun_bullet = 7;
                }

                if ( ai_picked == true && !ready_for_day4 )
                {
                    ready_for_day4 = true;
                    ai_picked = false;
                    player_gun_bullet = 7;
                }

                if ( ai_picked == true && !ready_for_day5 )
                {
                    ready_for_day5 = true;
                    ai_picked = false;
                    player_gun_bullet = 7;
                }

                if ( ai_picked == true && !ready_for_day_final )
                {
                    ready_for_day_final = true;
                    ai_picked = false;
                    player_gun_bullet = 7;
                }
            }
        }
In each game mode player can press key board and continue game. In stroy mode if player press enter than game will start. In game over if player press r than game will restart. If game mode is game start you can press r to reload bullet. (keyPressed.js)

    function keyPressed()
    {
        if ( game_mode === STORY )
        {

In sketch.js in each game mode a function will start. 

        if ( game_mode == MAIN_MENU )
        {
            main_menu();
        }

        if ( game_mode == HOW_TO_PLAY )

        }

        if ( game_mode == GAME_START )
        {
            . . .

When zombie's length is 0 in each days than background will change.

    if ( zombie_day1_length != 0 )
            {
                background( bg );
            }

            {
                background( bg4 );
            }

This statement can compute the delay_time for bullet delay.

    if ( delay < delay_time )
        {
            delay++;
        }

If day1 zombie is 0 than image will draw.

    if ( zombies_day1_wave1 != 0 )
        {
            day1_fadeout_img();
        }


To count frameCount this will use for time.

        else
    {
        count_start = false;
    }

    //frameCount works only at the GAME_START screen
    if ( count_start === false )
    {
        frameCount = 0;
    }

If reload_check is true than reload_ time will decrease. When player's bullet is 0 than reload_check will be true.

    //reload_check
    if ( reload_check == true )
    {
        reload_time--;
    }
    if ( reload_time == 0 )
    {
        reload_time = fixed_reload_time;
        reload_check = false;
        player_gun_bullet = 7;
    }

When game mode is game over than function will start. else than tint_value(it is for image) will reset 0.

    if ( game_mode == GAME_OVER )
    {
        if ( !ready_for_day_final )
        {
            game_over();
        }
        else
        {

        }
    }
    else
    {
        tint_value = 0;
    }

This is for intermission game mode in each day player has to pick ai to sacrifice.

    if ( zombie_day1_length <= 0 && game_mode != GAME_OVER )
        {
            game_mode = INTERMISSION;
            if ( !ready_for_day2 && game_mode == INTERMISSION )
            {
                . . .


This is for text when player's bullet become 0.

    if ( player_gun_bullet == 0 )
    {
        push();
        textSize( 10 );
        textAlign( CENTER );
        text( "press r to reload!", 40, height / 2 + 30 );
        pop();
    }

This statement is for ai's dieing message when ai picked.

    if ( ai_1_survived == false )
    {
        image( ai_img, 100,430 );
        fill("red");
        text("dead",100, 430);
        fill("black");
        text( "Lyon: Please tell my family my death.", width / 2, 90 );
    }
    if ( ai_2_survived == false )
    {
        image( ai2_img, 200, 430 )
        fill("red");
        text("dead",200, 430);
        fill("black");;
        text( "Elon: Do not make my death wasted...", width / 2, 120 );
    }
    if ( ai_3_survived == false )
    {
        image( ai3_img, 300, 430 );
        fill("red");
        text("dead",300, 430);
        fill("black");
        text( "Alexander: I respect your decision.", width / 2, 150 );
    }
    if ( ai_4_survived == false )
    {
        image( ai4_img, 400, 430 );
        fill("red");
        text("dead",400, 430);
        fill("black");
        text( "Hudson: NO!! Why me? Go to hell you all", width / 2, 180 );
    }

If ai is picked and tombstone will draw.

    if ( ai_1_survived ) ai_1.draw();
    else image( tombstone_img, ai_1.x, ai_1.y );
    if ( ai_2_survived ) ai_2.draw();
    else image( tombstone_img, ai_2.x, ai_2.y );
    if ( ai_3_survived ) ai_3.draw();
    else image( tombstone_img, ai_3.x, ai_3.y );
    if ( ai_4_survived ) ai_4.draw();
    else image( tombstone_img, ai_4.x, ai_4.y );

If mouse is on ai than the message and some image will come out
    if ( ai_1.x - 30 < mouseX && mouseX < ai_1.x + 30 && ai_1.y - 30 < mouseY && mouseY < ai_1.y + 30 )
    {
        fill("white");
            rect(ai_1.x + 50, ai_1.y-10,250,50);
            fill( 'black' );
            //image( textBox_img, ai_1.x, ai_1.y - 35 );
            text( " Lyon : My family is waiting for me. Please save me! \n", ai_1.x + 50, ai_1.y );
            . . .

If mouse is pressed than ai, ai's bullet and ai_picked value will be change.

    if ( mouseIsPressed )
    {
        ai_1_isShoot = false;
        ai_1_survived = false;
        ai_picked = true;
    }

When wall's hp is decrease the new image about wall is drawing.

    if(this.wall_health>250)
        {
            image( wall_img, this.x, this.y );
        }
        else if(this.wall_health>150&& this.wall_health<250)
        {
            image(braking_wall_img, this.x, this.y);
        }
        else{
            image(braking_wall2_img, this.x, this.y);
        }

It is for game over. If wall become 0 or less then game over.

        //If wall become 0 or less then game over.
        if ( this.wall_health <= 0 )
        {
            game_mode = GAME_OVER;
        }

When zombie type is 0, 1, 2 the zombie will draw and update. It is important for make a distinction zombie.

        if ( this.zombie_type === 0 )
        {
            this.zombie_hp = this.normal_zombie_hp; //normal_zombie
        }
        else if ( this.zombie_type === 1 )
        {
            this.zombie_hp = this.fast_zombie_hp; //fast_zombie
        }
        else if ( this.zombie_type === 2 )
        {
            this.zombie_hp = this.fat_zombie_hp; //fat_zombie

        if ( this.zombie_type === 0 ) //normal_zombie
        {
            this.speed = 70 * ( deltaTime / 1000 ) + this.random_moving_x; //original 70
            this.draw_normal_zombies();
        }
        else if ( this.zombie_type === 1 ) //fast_zombie
        {
            this.speed = 250 * ( deltaTime / 1000 ) + this.random_moving_x;    //original 250
            this.draw_fast_zombies();
        }
        else if ( this.zombie_type === 2 ) //fat_zombie
        {
            this.speed = 30 * ( deltaTime / 1000 ) + this.random_fat_moving_x; //original 30
            this.draw_fat_zombies();
        }
    else
    {
        this.speed = 50 * ( deltaTime / 1000 );
        this.draw_fat_zombies();
    }

When zombie is reach to wall it will stop this statement do that.

    //zombie stops at wall
    if ( this.x > game_wall.x + zombie_size )
    {
        this.x -= this.speed;
    }


## <span style="color:skyblue">  Loops </span>

This loop is looping until ai bullet length and function runs. (ai_setting.js)

    for ( var i = 0; i < ai_bullet_1.length; i++ )
        {
            ai_bullet_1[ i ].run();
        }

It is for zombie waves. To set how many zombies are and spawn its. This loops are in zombie_day1~5.

    for ( let count1 = 0; count1 < 30; count1++ )
    {
        zombies_final_wave1[ count1 ] = new zombies();
    }

This for loops is for draw bullet.

    for ( var i = 0; i < bullet.length; i++ )
    {
        bullet[ i ].draw_bullet();

        if ( bullet[ i ].x <= 0 || bullet[ i ].y <= 0 || bullet[ i ].x >= width+20 || bullet[ i ].y >= height )
        {
            bullet.splice( i, 1 );
        } //if ball goes out of frame, delete the ball from the array.
    }

This for day count(means zombie waves for days) and run update.

    for ( let count = 0; count < day_count.length; count++ )
    {
        day_count[ count ].update();
    }

If there are collision with bullet and zombie bullets will always disappear. If zombie's health become 0 than zombie will disappear.

    //player_bullet_zombie collision
    for ( let bullet_count = 0; bullet_count < bullet.length; bullet_count++ )
    {
        for ( let i = 0; i < day_count.length; i++ )
        {
            x_dis = day_count[ i ].x - bullet[ bullet_count ].x;
            y_dis = day_count[ i ].y - bullet[ bullet_count ].y;
            distance = sqrt( x_dis * x_dis + y_dis * y_dis );
             . . .

In canvas there are 5 lines this loops means 5 lines. Each line there will be ais and player.

    function drawing_lines_characters()  //drawing lines and characters
    {
        for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
